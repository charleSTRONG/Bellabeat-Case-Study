# Bellabeat-Case-Study
This Bellabeat case study is a capstone project for the completion of my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course.

Bellabeat is a high-tech company that creates smart products having a focus on health. One of the founders utilized her background as an artist to create beautifully designed technology that educates and motivates women around the world.

In this case study, I executed several practical tasks as a junior data analyst working for the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat. The project was done using Microsoft Excel and Python.
