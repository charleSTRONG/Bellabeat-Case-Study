# Bellabeat-Case-Study
This Bellabeat case study is a capstone project for the completion of my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course.

Bellabeat is a high-tech company that creates smart products having a focus on health. One of the founders utilized her background as an artist to create beautifully designed technology that educates and motivates women around the world.

The marketing analytics team was assigned to get insights into how people are currently using their smart devices and use the information to get recommendations on how Bellabeat's marketing strategy can be driven by these trends.

In this case study, I executed several practical tasks as a junior data analyst working for the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat. The project was done using Microsoft Excel and Python.
